# FlowMate_Team5

**FlowMate - Medical Software Engineering Exam - Group 5 - University of Salerno - 2025/26**

FlowMate is an application that aims to provide users with the ability to automate specific tasks by defining "Rules" composed of a trigger and an associated action (e.g., playing an audio, displaying a dialog box...). The development of the application involves a team of 4 people (Sabatino Ester, Pecoraro Sara, Della Corte Alessio, Siddiqa Ayesha), who are following the agile SCRUM process for project implementation. More information can be found in the links provided below.

## Used Technologies

The team has chosen **Java (specifically, JDK 17)** as the primary programming language for application development. The software logic will be unit tested using the **JUnit 5 framework**. All development activities, including coding and debugging, will take place within the **IntelliJ (IDE)**. For the graphical user interface (GUI), **JavaFX** will be employed, where the view controllers are managed by FXML files which are designed and generated using the **SceneBuilder** application.

## Scrum Artifacts

The following document contains all the SCRUM artifacts: from the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog to the Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives for all three sprints.
